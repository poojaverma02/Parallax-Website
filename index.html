        <h3 class="secHeading">Adventure Time!!</h3>
        <p class="text">
          An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is
          typically bold, sometimes risky.[1] Adventures may be activities with
          danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing,
          scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports. Adventures are
          often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to
          achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only
          be obtained by such activities.
          <br />
          <br />
          Adventurous experiences create psychological arousal,[2] which can be
          interpreted as negative (e.g. fear) or positive (e.g. flow). For some
          people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According
          to adventurer Andr√© Malraux, in his Man's Fate (1933), "If a man is
          not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?"

          <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Biking is a top-notch cardio workout. You'll burn about 400 calories
          an hour. Plus it strengthens your lower body, including your legs,
          hips, and glutes. If you want a workout that's gentle on your back,
          hips, knees, and ankles, this is a great choice. You can cycle on the
          road, a bike path, or a mountain trail. Indoors, you can do your
          workout on a stationary bike or buy a stand, called an indoor trainer,
          for your outdoor bike.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you're a beginner, choose a flat bike path or road. If you're ready
          for a tougher workout that also engages your upper body and core, try
          mountain biking. It's also called off-road biking. You can do it on
          trails and different types of rough terrain. Mountain biking is
          trickier because you have to navigate hills and surfaces, so your
          upper body and core will kick into gear. It's more of a total-body
          workout than biking on the road, which is mostly a lower-body cardio
          workout.

          <h2 class="desc">PARAGLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of
          flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider
          aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a
          harness or lies prone in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric
          wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure
          of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic
          forces of the air flowing over the outside.
          <br />
          <br />
          Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours
          and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five
          hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By
          skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height,
          often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

          <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or
          two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section,
          or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer
          towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on
          ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open
          ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave
          pools.
          <br />
          <br />
          The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board,
          regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche
          of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of
          the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft.
          Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the
          modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding
          a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up
          surfing.
